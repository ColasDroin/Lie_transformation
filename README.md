# Lie_transformation

mall Python module to generate the Hamiltonian for a given multipole order, and find the Lie transformation accordingly. Possibility to make it symplectic by computing the corresponding Yoshida coefficients. Then compare the results for a closed-form solution, truncated map, and symplectic truncated map.
